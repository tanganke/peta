# Parameter-Efficient Task Arithmetic

Code for paper "Parameter Efficient Multi-task Model Fusion with Partial Linearization"
([Arixv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04742))

This work introduces a novel method to improve multi-task fusion for parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques. 
The approach involves partially linearizing the adapter modules and applying task arithmetic over these linearized adapters, combining the benefits of model fusion with efficient fine-tuning and inference.
